# Order Demand distribution Dashboard

The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize the distribution of order demand across the days of the week and shifts of the day. It allows for filtering by client and region and was developed using the Dash framework, with the assistance of Pymongo for querying the database and Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy for data processing. Deployed to Heroku.
